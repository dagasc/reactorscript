Improve your everyday chatting experience!
This mIRC script has been in development for over 21 years! Made for my own personal needs and comfort, the idea is to keep it clean, simple, and easy to use.

There are many great features:
Away System (silent) - Multi-server Connections Manager
Auto-login to Network Services - Auto-login as IRC Operator
Eggdrop Support - ZNC Support - Remote Administrator
... and a lot more awesome stuff!

Script works on all networks, but main supported are:
DALnet, mIRCScripts, Libera.Chat, freenode, Undernet and Quakenet
